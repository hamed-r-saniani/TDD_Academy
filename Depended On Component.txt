1-Indirect Input = We Have a Component That We Depend On It and Will Get From It a Data and in Test Process Give us Data or Throw Exception.
2-Indirect Output = Our Test May Be Have Not Result or Not Change Any State That End of It We Should Verify (Assert It) At The End Test Call a Method Like SaveChanges() or Update().

Usually Indirect Inputs, Inputs That we dont Assert On it(dont Verify it) They in process of test just provide data to complete work.

But Indirect Outputs End of Work and thats important verify them(Check that they call or not).
