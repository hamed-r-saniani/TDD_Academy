refers to Setup Phase of Test

-do all work and prerequisite for run SUT

Transient =

mean that is not It is not permanent and will disappear(Disposed)

in example is a object in memory 

Persistent =

store in somewhere(database or memory or...)

in example a user that we create in database(and delete after use) 
or in memory and share between many test classes

Fresh =

mean create now (for each test create)

Shared =

share between many tests


-Combinations of these:

1- Transient Fresh = 
-In Unit Test
-Not Teardown

2-Persistent Fresh =
-Not in Unit Test
-Have Teardown

3-Persistent Shared =
-Share between Test suites
example a id or connectionString that share between many tests

4-Persistent immutable Shared =
we have a fixture that share between many test and each of test dont allow change it just use it.
a better practice than Persistent Shared because if we run tests parallel may a test change our Shared Fixture and next test dont want it and failed
