refers to Setup Phase of Test

-do all work and prerequisite for run SUT

Transient =

mean that is not It is not permanent and will disappear(Disposed)

in example is a object in memory 

Persistent =

store in somewhere(database or memory or...)

in example a user that we create in database(and delete after use) 
or in memory and share between many test classes

Fresh =

mean create now (for each test create)

Shared =

share between many tests


-Combinations of these:

1- Transient Fresh = 
-In Unit Test
-Not Teardown

2-Persistent Fresh =
-Not in Unit Test
-Have Teardown

3-Persistent Shared =
-Share between Test suites
example a id or connectionString that share between many tests

4-Persistent immutable Shared =
we have a fixture that share between many test and each of test dont allow change it just use it.
a better practice than Persistent Shared because if we run tests parallel may a test change our Shared Fixture and next test dont want it and failed


-Fixture Creation:

1- Inline =
-Delegated

main that we create manually in where we want use it
or inline delegated mean that a factory method create it

2- Implicit =
-Framework Hook:
1) Constructor and Disposable Method of Test Class
2) IClassFixture<T>
3) Collection and ICollectionFixture<T>


Framework Hook Create it




Tip:
In Any Test Class Constructor Run Before Any Fact on that Class and if Inherit IDisposable and Implement Dispose method on That Class Dispose Method Run After Any Fact on That Class.





### What are Hooks in Unit Testing?

Hooks are special methods in unit testing frameworks that allow you to run some code at specific points in the test lifecycle. These hooks are typically used to set up the test environment before tests run and to clean up afterward. Different testing frameworks support various hooks, but the concept remains largely the same across frameworks.

### Common Hooks in Unit Testing Frameworks

Most unit testing frameworks, such as NUnit, xUnit, and JUnit, provide a set of commonly used hooks:

1. **Setup (`[SetUp]` / `@Before` / `BeforeEach`):**
   - This hook is run before each individual test. It's commonly used to initialize objects or set up the necessary environment for the test.

2. **Tear Down (`[TearDown]` / `@After` / `AfterEach`):**
   - This hook is executed after each individual test. It’s used to clean up any resources that were initialized in the Setup hook.

3. **One-Time Setup (`[OneTimeSetUp]` / `@BeforeClass` / `BeforeAll`):**
   - This hook runs once before any tests in the test suite are executed. It’s useful for setting up expensive shared resources.

4. **One-Time Tear Down (`[OneTimeTearDown]` / `@AfterClass` / `AfterAll`):**
   - This hook runs once after all tests in the test suite have been executed. It’s used to clean up resources that were initialized in the One-Time Setup.

### Example in xUnit (C#)

Here is an example of how you might use these hooks in the xUnit framework for C#:

```csharp
public class CalculatorTests : IDisposable
{
    private Calculator _calculator;

    // This runs before each test
    public CalculatorTests()
    {
        _calculator = new Calculator();
    }

    // This runs after each test
    public void Dispose()
    {
        // Perform any cleanup here
    }

    [Fact]
    public void Add_WithTwoNumbers_ReturnsTheirSum()
    {
        // Arrange
        int a = 5;
        int b = 3;
        
        // Act
        int result = _calculator.Add(a, b);
        
        // Assert
        Assert.Equal(8, result);
    }
}
```

### Summary

Hooks in unit testing are extremely useful for setting up and tearing down the conditions required for your tests to run correctly. They help you write cleaner, more maintainable tests by encapsulating setup and teardown logic, ensuring that each test starts with a clean state and that resources are appropriately reclaimed afterward.

### What are Hooks in Unit Testing and Example of them in xunit?

Hooks are special methods in unit testing frameworks that allow you to run some code at specific points in the test lifecycle. These hooks are typically used to set up the test environment before tests run and to clean up afterward.

### Common Hooks in xUnit

In xUnit, there are two primary hooks for setting up and tearing down your test environment:

1. **Setup (Constructor) and Tear Down (Dispose) for each test**:
   - The constructor of the test class is used for setup before each test.
   - The `Dispose` method is used for teardown after each test.

2. **One-Time Setup (`IClassFixture`) and One-Time Tear Down (`IClassFixture`) for a test class**:
   - `IClassFixture` is used to run setup and teardown once for all tests in the test class.

### Example: Hooks for Each Test

Here is an example of how you might use the constructor for setup and `Dispose` for teardown in xUnit.

```csharp
using Xunit;

public class CalculatorTests : IDisposable
{
    private Calculator _calculator;

    // This runs before each test
    public CalculatorTests()
    {
        _calculator = new Calculator();
    }

    // This runs after each test
    public void Dispose()
    {
        // Perform any cleanup here
    }

    [Fact]
    public void Add_WithTwoNumbers_ReturnsTheirSum()
    {
        // Arrange
        int a = 5;
        int b = 3;
        
        // Act
        int result = _calculator.Add(a, b);
        
        // Assert
        Assert.Equal(8, result);
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- **Constructor**:
  - Runs before each test to create a new instance of `Calculator`.
- **Dispose**:
  - Runs after each test to perform any necessary cleanup.

### Example: One-Time Setup and Tear Down

For one-time setup and teardown, you can use the `IClassFixture<T>` interface. Here is an example:

```csharp
// Define a fixture class
public class CalculatorFixture : IDisposable
{
    public Calculator Calculator { get; private set; }

    public CalculatorFixture()
    {
        // This runs once before any test
        Calculator = new Calculator();
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        // This runs once after all tests
        // Perform any cleanup here
    }
}

// Use the fixture class in your test class
public class CalculatorTests : IClassFixture<CalculatorFixture>
{
    private CalculatorFixture _fixture;

    public CalculatorTests(CalculatorFixture fixture)
    {
        _fixture = fixture;
    }

    [Fact]
    public void Add_WithTwoNumbers_ReturnsTheirSum()
    {
        // Arrange
        int a = 5;
        int b = 3;
        
        // Act
        int result = _fixture.Calculator.Add(a, b);
        
        // Assert
        Assert.Equal(8, result);
    }

    [Fact]
    public void Subtract_WithTwoNumbers_ReturnsTheirDifference()
    {
        // Arrange
        int a = 5;
        int b = 3;
        
        // Act
        int result = _fixture.Calculator.Subtract(a, b);
        
        // Assert
        Assert.Equal(2, result);
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- **CalculatorFixture**:
  - The constructor runs once before any test in the test class to initialize shared resources.
  - The `Dispose` method runs once after all tests in the test class have executed.
- **CalculatorTests**:
  - The test class implements `IClassFixture<CalculatorFixture>`, ensuring that the `CalculatorFixture` is used for setup and teardown.
  - Tests use the shared instance of `Calculator` provided by the fixture.

### Summary

xUnit provides a simple and effective way to run setup and teardown logic through constructors and `Dispose` methods for instance-level setup/teardown and through `IClassFixture<T>` for class-level setup/teardown. This helps you ensure that your tests are isolated and that resources are properly managed, leading to more reliable and maintainable tests.
