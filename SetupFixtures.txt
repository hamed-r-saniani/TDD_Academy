refers to Setup Phase of Test

-do all work and prerequisite for run SUT

Transient =

mean that is not It is not permanent and will disappear(Disposed)

in example is a object in memory 

Persistent =

store in somewhere(database or memory or...)

in example a user that we create in database(and delete after use) 
or in memory and share between many test classes

Fresh =

mean create now (for each test create)

Shared =

share between many tests


-Combinations of these:

1- Transient Fresh = 
-In Unit Test
-Not Teardown

2-Persistent Fresh =
-Not in Unit Test
-Have Teardown

3-Persistent Shared =
-Share between Test suites
example a id or connectionString that share between many tests

4-Persistent immutable Shared =
we have a fixture that share between many test and each of test dont allow change it just use it.
a better practice than Persistent Shared because if we run tests parallel may a test change our Shared Fixture and next test dont want it and failed


-Fixture Creation:

1- Inline =
-Delegated

main that we create manually in where we want use it
or inline delegated mean that a factory method create it

2- Implicit =
-Framework Hook:
1) Constructor and Disposable Method of Test Class
2) IClassFixture<T>
3) Collection and ICollectionFixture<T>


Framework Hook Create it




Tip:
In Any Test Class Constructor Run Before Any Fact on that Class and if Inherit IDisposable and Implement Dispose method on That Class Dispose Method Run After Any Fact on That Class.
